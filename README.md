# Bank-Customer-Churn-Data-Analysis-
Creating a dashboard in excel to help understand a large data set of banking client data 
To start I worked with the raw data to make a working set of more usable data. I created a column that grouped customers ages to help make more readable dashboard visuals.
After this I turned all binary data into readable inputs making it easier for end users to understand the data 
Next I created pivot tables which assisted me in creating charts to visualize the data
To create the dashboard I added a slicer to each pivot table to help the end user better understand how different set varables impact each data set
